# About Us

Alternative Medicine Thailand (AMT) is a leading medical-grade cannabis company, committed to exploring new avenues of alternative medicine in Myanmar by cultivating our products in Thailand. Our mission is to help consumers and healthcare providers understand the benefits of cannabis as a health-supporting medicinal product.

Our vision is to become a world-recognized Myanmar cannabis company, leveraging the opportunity provided by the Thai government to spread knowledge globally. We offer high-quality cannabis flowers, specifically suitable for medicinal purposes, and have developed an FDA-approved cannabis medicine distributed nationwide.

Led by Executive Director Min Thway @ Michael, our team works closely with Smart Medical Development and Cannabis Experts to ensure we stay at the forefront of the industry. Our partnerships with Pacific Cannovation Group and CannaGen further strengthen our position in the market.

With an initial funding round of 24 million baht, we project to break even after our 24th month in operations. By the end of 2025, we aim to raise an additional 75 million baht to support our expansion plans, including engaging 20 more greenhouses in our projected area and exporting medicines, oils, and consumer products to Myanmar and Japan.

As we continue to grow, we are dedicated to maintaining the highest standards for quality, purity, and customer satisfaction. At AMT, we are passionate about providing innovative and effective alternative medicine solutions that improve the lives of our customers.
