# About Us

Alternative Medicine Thailand (AMT) is dedicated to exploring new avenues of alternative medicine in Myanmar by cultivating medical-grade cannabis in Thailand. Our vision is to become a world-recognized Myanmar cannabis company, and to educate consumers and parents about the health-supporting benefits of cannabis as a medicinal product. By taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the Thai government, we aim to spread this knowledge globally.

AMT is an all-in-one cannabis company, focusing on growing, manufacturing, and distributing high-quality medicinal cannabis products. Our carefully chosen growing site is environmentally suitable for cannabis cultivation and enjoys protection from the government of Nakon Rachashima. Pak Chong is situated alongside the most recognized national park in Thailand and is easily accessible from the center of Bangkok.

Our mission is to become the leading cannabis company in Myanmar, with the goal of supplying 90% of the domestic cannabis market. We aim to position ourselves as a key player in the industry, offering extraction facilities and advising the Myanmar government when full legalization is achieved.

AMT is led by Chief Executive Officer Min Thway (@Michael), who works closely with Smart Medical Development and Cannabis Experts. With a passion for plants and a background in developing beach properties in Myanmar, Min Thway has studied cannabis since the first legalization of cannabis in Asia (Thailand).

Our company collaborates with Pacific Cannovation Group and CannaGen to form strategic partnerships, positioning ourselves at the forefront of the industry. With an initial funding round of 24 million baht, we aim to raise another 75 million baht in additional funds by the end of 2025. We project to break even after our 24th month in operations and plan to engage 20 additional greenhouses in our projected area. Medicines, oils, and consumer products derived from cannabis will be exported to Myanmar and Japan markets.

AMT is already registered and will grow and sell cannabis on 4.5 Rai (2 acres) of private land located near the Bangkok River in Pak Chong District. We are constructing and cultivating our business using Japanese technology in cooperation with the PACCAN TEAM. Our infrastructure includes a greenhouse, office, electricity, water supply, and dry room. SMD (Smart Medical Development) manages the plantation on 4.5 Rai.

We focus on producing health and medicinal cannabis products according to established regulations. Our products, grown using advanced technologies, the best seeds, and the most suitable natural fertilizers, are designed to penetrate both domestic and international markets. Our target customers include visitors to Thailand and residents who expect to purchase our packaged products, ornamental plants, and visit our edible bar.

Our marketing plan involves building a strong brand name and targeting specific customers, attracting and selling to local customers while focusing on the production and sale of finished products to the international market. We aim to develop a strong brand and positioning, identify and target specific customer segments, break even, and establish partnerships and distribution channels. We also plan to utilize digital marketing, e-commerce, sales promotions, and customer loyalty programs.

At AMT, we strive to grow day by day, increasing our efficiency and capacity while maintaining the highest quality of our products. Our operation will be the pinnacle and production hub for distribution in Myanmar, and by 2026, we plan to add cannabis tourism to our line of products.
