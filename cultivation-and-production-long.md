# Cultivation and Production

At Alternative Medicine Thailand (AMT), our commitment to excellence begins with the cultivation and production processes we employ to create our high-quality, medical-grade cannabis products. We adhere to the strictest industry standards and utilize advanced technologies to ensure that our products consistently meet and exceed the expectations of our customers.

## Cultivation

Our cannabis cultivation takes place on a 4.5 Rai (2 acres) private land near the Bangkok River in Pak Chong District. The site is situated alongside the most recognized national park in Thailand and is easily accessible from the center of Bangkok. We have chosen this location for its environmental suitability for cannabis cultivation and the protection provided by the government of Nakon Rachashima.

To guarantee the highest quality cannabis, we employ a combination of organic hydroponics and soil growth techniques. Our facility operates as a closed system with stringent environmental controls. Ambient air temperature and relative humidity (RH%) are monitored in real-time and regulated accordingly. Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment is employed to enhance photosynthesis, maximizing plant yield and efficiency.

The indoor air quality is constantly monitored, and advanced systems are in place throughout the structure to maintain a mold-free environment for the safety of our staff and the health of the plants. Our focus on environmental and biological control ensures that the medicine cultivated will be of the highest level of purity possible.

## Production

Our production processes are designed to preserve the integrity of the cannabis plant and its valuable compounds. We employ advanced extraction methods to obtain pure and potent cannabis extracts for use in our products. Our state-of-the-art facility is equipped with the latest technology to ensure that our production processes are efficient, consistent, and compliant with all industry standards and regulations.

Our collaboration with the PacCan Group and Smart Medical Development enables us to leverage cutting-edge Japanese technology and expertise in our cultivation and production processes. This partnership ensures that our products are created using the best possible methods, resulting in a superior final product.

## Quality Assurance

Quality assurance is at the core of our cultivation and production processes. We are dedicated to producing the finest cannabis products, and as such, we implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure that our products consistently meet the highest standards for purity, potency, and safety.

All our products are subject to extensive third-party lab testing to verify their quality and compliance with regulatory requirements. This commitment to quality assurance gives our customers confidence in the safety and efficacy of our products.

At AMT, our cultivation and production processes are designed to provide our customers with the highest quality medical-grade cannabis products on the market. Our commitment to excellence, combined with our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, positions us as a leading provider of medical cannabis in the region.
