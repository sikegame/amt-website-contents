# Cultivation and Production

At Alternative Medicine Thailand (AMT), we take pride in our meticulous cultivation and production processes, ensuring our medical-grade cannabis products are of the highest quality and purity.

Our state-of-the-art cultivation facility is situated near the Bangkok River in Pak Chong District, Thailand, on 2 acres of private land. We utilize Japanese technology in collaboration with the PACCAN TEAM to create a closed system with strict environmental control, maximizing plant yield and efficiency.

Our cultivation techniques employ organic hydroponics and soil growth methods, with continuous monitoring and regulation of ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide levels. To maintain a mold-free environment for the safety of staff and plants, indoor air quality is also closely monitored.

AMT's production focus is on health and medicinal cannabis products, which adhere to established regulations. Our goal is to supply these products domestically and penetrate international markets with our advanced, high-quality offerings.

By combining our expertise in cultivation and production with our commitment to innovation and excellence, AMT remains a trusted provider of medical-grade cannabis products.
